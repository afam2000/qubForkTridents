My first Minecraft server plugin adds small QOL functionality to Loyalty Tridents. Developed and tested on 1.18.1 Paper server, but should work with Bukkit and Spigot as well.

Features--
Thrown Tridents will attach to dropped items+exp orbs on the ground, this means you can use Loyalty to spear out of reach items back to you!
Killing a mob with a trident will also automatically attach its' drops+exp orbs to the Trident.

Tridents can impale Players [Default: True] *Players can pullthemselves off of Trident same way as exiting a Vehicle/Mount.
  /togglecanimpale
  
Having Looting in your offhand works again [Default: True] *So not tied to Trident in main hand, as long as you get credit for kill it will simulate looting enchant.
  /togglelootsim 

Maybes--
clientside Reserve Loyalty Trident Slot
